> A "practical proof" and implementation of the recursion theorem.

This implements a "practical proof" to [Roger's fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_recursion_theorem#Rogers's_fixed-point_theorem), sometimes also known as the quine theorem or (falsely) recursion theorem.

## Usage

Oh god FIXME

## Background

FIXME

## TODOs

* Clean up code
  * Nicer inclusion of safe_eval() in the quine
* Show to other people
* Enjoy even more! :D
* Other languages?

## NOTDOs

Here are some things this project will definitely not support:
* Support libraries or any other interaction.  The theorem is about *functions*.  As soon as you interact with the rest of the system, that's not a *function* in the input (i.e. `sim_input`) anymore, in the strict mathematical sense.
* Care about memory or time issues â€“ Yes, your computer is not a Turing machine, therefore the transformation might be able to distinguish the phases by allocating a bunch of memory.  But that's kinda cheating.

## Contribute

The previous two sections are just cornerstones.
